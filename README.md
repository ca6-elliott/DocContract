Document Registry Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract provides a secure and decentralized way to store and manage documents on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to upload and store their documents, which are then hashed and recorded on the blockchain. Once uploaded, the documents cannot be deleted or modified, ensuring their integrity and authenticity.

Features:
- Secure document storage and management on the Ethereum blockchain
- Document hashing and encryption for added security
- Access control for document upload and management
- Easy integration with existing applications and workflows

To use this contract, simply deploy it to the Ethereum network and interact with it using a web3-enabled application or the Ethereum command line interface. Full documentation and example code is provided in the "docs" directory of this repository.
